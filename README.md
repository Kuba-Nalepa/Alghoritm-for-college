# Division Algorithm

### Description of the project
Write Kotlin Code that as an input accepts an array consisting of three numbers (integers).
The code should change these numbers to meet the folowing requirements:
#### 1. Each number should be divisible by three
#### 2. Sum of all three numbers should be as large as possible
Changing
a number means increasing  (decreasing is not allowed) any of tis digits. Increasing a digit by
one means one change, that is increasing a digit by a five would mean five changes.
You can perform up to six changes total for all three numbers.
### For example:
#### 1. [110, 222, 3333] can be changed to [111, 222, 3333] - this is one change
#### 2. [111, 222, 33] can be changed to [114, 333, 33] - here we have six changes

You can distribute among numbers as you wish.
Digit 9 cannot be changed!

## Examplary solution
### INPUT: [784, 4765, 5291]
### OUTPUT: [984, 6765, 6291]
